## Installation

We're using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) here:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## API documentation

You will find an exemple of how to use our api in the file **authenticationService.js**.

**IMPORTANT** : Look at the `httpService.js` file to understand how to call the service.
The `key` or `x-api-key` in the request header is the secret key of the login page, and the `jwt` is obtained by calling the login service.

Header :

```
accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7,es;q=0.6,it;q=0.5,de;q=0.4
//authorization:
x-api-key: Mitrfd3Ev45e3tvzmOYeT7HdMe4jGEpN5rawgNGM

```

### Routes
